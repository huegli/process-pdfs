- If there is more than one category, sort them alphabetically
- IMPORTANT: Use ONLY category words from the 'Allowed Categories' list below, If no applicable category can be found, use "reviewcategory" instead
- If a file mentions lucy, mikhaila, vincent or kahlea explicitly, use the respective word as one of the categories
- Any file that mentions "Brookside Lane" should have the category "home" and "sandiego" associated with it
- Any file that mentions "Elizabeth Lane" should have the category "home" and "danville" associated with it
- Any file that mentions "Seahorn Cirle" should have the category "rental" and "sandiego" associated with it
